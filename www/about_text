Dino Interactive is a small company started in January 2009 by Marco Dinacci (link to linkedin).
After 6 years working in sectors like IT, telecommunications, multimedia and aerospace, I created this company to work on my own personal projects, for education, fun, and profit. 
 
The first project I'm working on is a remake of an old videogame that I was used to play on a Commodore 16 twenty years ago. There is no release date yet, although it will probably be around the end of 2010.

At the same time I do consultancy work, especially in the aerospace field, in order to pay my bills. 
If you're interested in my services feel free to contact me by e-mail (jobs@dinointeractive.com). You can take a look at my detailed Curriculum Vitae (english | french) to see what I've done in the past although I look with much more interest new sort of challenges.
I prefer to telecommute but I can relocate everywhere for short periods of time.
