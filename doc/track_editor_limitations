- Straight curves can't have elevation.
  As I discard all the tiles between two straight segments and I interpolate
  only four control points, there is no way to specify a precise Z value.

- Curve segments can't turn
  For instance, in a f-l-f curve, the 'l' segment can't have curves, I would
  need to modify idxStart and idxEnd in order to do this.
