SAVE FORMAT GUIDE

HOW IT IS NOW:

The dicionary of each entity is saved down to disk. 
A couple of properties are replaced as they are unpickable:

- nodePath
- parent (the UID is saved, and during the loading the node is reconnected)
- geom (it is recreated at loading time)


HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE:

Level files are stored in Panda3D Multifiles.
A single Multifile contains:

- a BAM file with all the entities required to start the level
  This file is generated by "bamifying" the root scene node.
- a version string of the type "v<number>", ex. "v0.2". It is stored in a line
  terminated with a "\n" character.
- a pickle file containing the attributes from the entities required to start
  the level. There are only two attributes missing:
  - render.nodepath
  - physics.geom
  They are missing because they can't be pickled. 
  To recreate the nodepath, just get it from the scene using the UID.
  To recreate the geometry and insert the object into the physic space, call
  POM.createGeomForEntity(attributes, position), where attributes are the
  physics params (obj.physics)

References to assests files are stored inside the entities dictionary and it
is not necessary to store them in the Multifile although it is recommended
for the delivery of the game.
