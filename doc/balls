In Championship mode only one ball can be chosen.
In Time Battle mode the ball can be changed for each track

Interesting combinations:

1. "Photon"

speed = 90
control = 20
jump = 20

2. "Shark"

speed = 70
control = 40
jump = 40

3. "Average Joe"

speed = 50
control = 70
jump = 60

4. "Turtle King"

speed = 20
control = 90
jump = 90

Shark=1
Average Joe=2
Turtle King=3
