The track is a valid Python file containing a tuple of dictionaries, where each dictionary 
represents a track segment.
A segment has a type, which can be one of the following:

- 0: a straight segment
- 1: a straight right curve
- 2: a straight left curve
- 3: a straight right curve, pointing up
- 4: a straight left curve, pointing up
- 5: a 22° curve, pointing right
- 6: a 22° curve, pointing left
- etc... I need plenty of types for elevation...

Finally, the tiles type is encoded in a list and separated by a character "-"

NJAHD-NNNHH

Letters mean:

N: Neutral
A: Accelerate
D: Decelerate
H: Hole
J: Jump
I: Invert
B: Bounce back
C: Checkpoint

Example:

track=(
    {"type":0, "tiles":"NJNSN-NNJBN-NNINN-NHHAN-NANND-NBNHN"},
    {"type":1, "tiles":"NJNSN-NNJBN-NHINN-NHHAN-NANND-NBNHN"},
)

The track is generated by a script that reads the intermediate format and export to bam
